  caveats <<~EOS
    PullPing is self-signed with a stable identity (not notarized), so on first launch macOS may block it.
    Right-click PullPing in /Applications and choose Open, or run once:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/PullPing.app"

    Tokens are stored in your login keychain (items com.padina.pullping.*);
    remove them from Keychain Access when uninstalling.
