  caveats <<~EOS
    Window Organizer is self-signed (not notarized), so on first launch macOS may block it.
    Open System Settings > Privacy & Security and click Open Anyway (right-click > Open no longer works on macOS 15+), or run once:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Window Organizer.app"

    Minimize and close need Accessibility permission. Since 0.2.0 the grant survives
    updates. Upgrading from 0.1.0, run once and grant again:
      tccutil reset Accessibility com.padina.window-organizer
