  caveats <<~EOS
    Agents Monitor is ad-hoc signed (not notarized), so on first launch macOS may block it.
    On macOS 15+ open it once, then click "Open Anyway" in System Settings > Privacy & Security, or run once:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/AgentsMonitor.app"

    Renamed from claude-monitor. If you had that cask installed, remove the old app and
    its stale login item:
      brew uninstall --cask claude-monitor
      rm -rf /Applications/ClaudeMonitor.app
    Your accounts, settings and alert history migrate across automatically on first launch.
